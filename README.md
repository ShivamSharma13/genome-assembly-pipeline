Pre-running installations

1. Firstly, a java runtime environment is needed to install FastQC. this was done by the command 
wget https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk8-binaries/releases/download/jdk8u232-b09/OpenJDK8U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_8u232b09.tar.gz
java was then exported to the PATH

2. FastQC was downloaded using wget https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.9.zip and then subsequently unzipped. Permissions were then changed for the fastqc script using chmod 755 FastQC/fastqc.
